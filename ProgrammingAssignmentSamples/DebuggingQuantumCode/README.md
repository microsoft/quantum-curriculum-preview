# Debugging Quantum Programs (Example)

The Q# code in this task implements Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm for two example functions (one constant and one balanced). It contains exactly **7 bugs**, ranging from issues that will manifest as compilation errors to problems that will require running the fixed algorithm and analyzing its output. The list of bugs and their explanations is included in [DebuggingDJAgorithm-Solutions.pptx](.\DebuggingDJAgorithm-Solutions.pptx).

The assignment is distributed as a single file, DeutschJozsaCode.qs. The students should identify the bugs, fix them, 
and submit the code with fixed bugs, (optionally) accompanied by brief explanations of each bug.
