// Task 2. Distinguish |0...0⟩ state from W state.
// Input: N qubits (stored in an array of length N) which are guaranteed 
// to be either in the |0...0⟩ state or in the W state - 
// an equal superposition of all basis states that have exactly one |1⟩ in them.
// Output: 0 if the qubits were in the |0...0⟩ state,
//         1 if the qubits were in the W state.
